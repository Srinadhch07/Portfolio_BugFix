      <h2>Get to Know Me Better</h2>
      <p>I'm Siri Guduru, a passionate and results-driven software developer specializing in front-end technologies. I thrive on creating user-friendly and visually appealing web experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>

      <p>My core expertise lies in crafting clean, efficient, and maintainable code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently completed a portfolio project by learning and applying concepts from courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design. Through this journey, I built two portfoliosâ€”one using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and another using the React framework.</p>

      <p>Currently, I'm diving deeper into React and working on an exciting ongoing project: an Instagram Clone. This hands-on experience is helping me enhance my skills in component-based architecture and dynamic UI development.</p>

      <p>I'm excited to connect with companies and individuals who share my passion for building innovative and impactful web applications. I'm open to opportunities in both front-end and full-stack development, and always eager to learn and grow with the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
